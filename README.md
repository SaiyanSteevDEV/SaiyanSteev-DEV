# How I Started Out
I began venturing into programming at a young age with my grandpa, a former software developer with many years of experience. He introduced me to HTML, and together we made a website for my old YouTube channel (which is thankfully long gone now). After this experience, I learned some python with a book my father bought me, and made a simple word game. I started programming as a hobby in general around the age of 11.
